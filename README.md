## What is KinkShell?
Welcome to KinkShell, a new Dalamud mod for FFXIV that aims to enhance your roleplaying experience by connecting you with other KinkShell users in a more intimate way.

### How It Works
In the mod interface, users can establish "KinkShells" - similar to Linkshells or your typical chatroom. Some users may also choose to pair Bluetooth-enabled adult toys to their Windows PC, using Intiface Central. KinkShell allows you to join a session with other members of your KinkShell to exchange messages and toy commands in real time.

## Installation
To install this plugin, you must first add the [CatboyEngineering Plugin Repository](https://github.com/CatboyEngineering/Plugins) to your Dalamud Custom Plugin Repositories list. Follow the instructions at that link for more details.

Once the repository has been added, navigate to the list of available plugins, and search for "KinkShellClient" - add the plugin from the installer and proceed to the next section.

### Create an Account
Because of the sensitive nature of this plugin, and to facilitate easier sharing, KinkShell requires an account in order to connect. At the time of writing, it is in **closed beta**, and accounts are only given to select testers. If you are a tester, please visit the [KinkShell Account Page](https://kinkshell.catboy.engineering/) and register or login to see your account ID.

### Optional: Toy Setup
If you plan on using adult toys with KinkShell, you will need to install [Intiface Central](https://intiface.com/central/). Intiface is an intermediary program that connects to your toys and enables KinkShell to send commands. It is only required if you want to allow toy control. You can still send toy commands to other KinkShell users without Intiface.

### Plugin Settings
The next step is to open the plugin settings menu from inside Dalamud:

Enter the server address (e.g. `kinkshell.catboy.engineering`), along with the username and password you created during your account setup process.

If you are using Intiface Central, switch to the Intiface tab and provide the server address shown at the top of your Intiface window:

Click `Save and Close` - you're done with setup! Unless your information changes, this configuration won't need to change.

## Using Kinkshell
1. Launch FFXIV and use the `/kinkshell` to open the plugin menu.
2. The main window will appear, prompting you to connect to the server. Click `Connect` and wait for the window to update.
3. Once connected, you will see options to:
   - Create a new KinkShell
   - Edit any existing shells you own
   - Join any shells you've been added to
   - Refresh your list of shells available
   - Log out
4. To participate in a KinkShell session, click `Join` to join a shell in your list.
5. In the window that appears, use the chatbox or the Intiface command section to communicate with other users.
6. When your session is over, click `Leave` to disconnect. 

## Troubleshooting
###### Because this plugin is in development, technical support and documentation are limited. Please reach out to the developer with any concerns or questions.

### I can't connect to the server!
> Check that your server address and login information are correct. If you're unable to access the [KinkShell Account Page](https://kinkshell.catboy.engineering/), it's possible the server is down for maintenance.

### I can't get my toys to connect!
> This is likely due to your connection with Intiface Central. Make sure the application is open, and that you've clicked the "Start Server" button at the top. Please use Intiface Central's website for more detailed troubleshooting tips.
