# KinkShell (beta)
This plugin is currently in development. Not all features may work as expected, and user support is limited.

## Installation
To install this plugin, you must first add the [CatboyEngineering Plugin Repository](https://github.com/CatboyEngineering/Plugins) to your Dalamud Custom Plugin Repositories list. Follow the instructions at that link for more details.

Once the repository has been added, navigate to the list of available plugins, and search for "KinkShell" - add the plugin from the installer and proceed to the next section.

## Using Kinkshell
KinkShell is a plugin that uses a centralized server to synchronize users into "Kinkshells." Much like Linkshells, Kinkshells allow multiple users to join the same session and exchange messages and commands to other members in the group. To make all of this possible, you must first register for an account with the Kinkshell Server.

1. Launch FFXIV and use `/kinkshell` to open the plugin menu.
2. In the plugin settings, enter your Kinkshell login information and save.
3. In the plugin home screen, click Connect to authenticate.
4. TBD
