## What is KinkShell?
Welcome to KinkShell, a new Dalamud mod for FFXIV that aims to enhance your roleplaying experience by connecting you with other KinkShell users in a more intimate way.

### How It Works
In the mod interface, users can establish "KinkShells" - similar to Linkshells or your typical chatroom. Some users may also choose to pair Bluetooth-enabled adult toys to their Windows PC, using Intiface Central. KinkShell allows you to join a session with other members of your KinkShell to exchange messages and toy commands in real time.

## Set up
Head on over to the [KinkShell Wiki](https://github.com/CatboyEngineering/KinkShellClient/wiki) for instructions on getting started!
